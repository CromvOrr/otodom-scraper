# Otodom Scraper

### Overview

This project is a web scraper designed to extract real estate listings from **otodom.pl** for properties located in **Krak√≥w**,

specifically for **apartments for sale** (building type: **house**).

    The scraper can be easily adapted to collect data for any other real estate categories
    or locations by simply modifying the URL.

The code not only scrapes the listings but also generates some visualizations to help analyze the collected data.
